Hi, my name’s Nomin and I’m a data science researcher, a tutor of Math, and a soon-to-be graduate from the University of British Columbia. I've gained experience with the data science pipeline (preparing, cleaning, exploring, modeling, and interpreting data) from working in a research laboratory, on personal projects, and from formal courses.  

I enjoy learning things hands-on and like working with R, SQL, and Python for data science. I also love searching for "the right" questions that can be extracted from the datasets.
