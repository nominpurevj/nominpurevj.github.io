Hi, I’m Nomin! I’m a marketing science analyst with experience in marketing analytics, dashboard development, and research projects. I’ve worked with the full data pipeline—cleaning, exploring, modeling, and interpreting data—through my work, personal projects, and courses.

I love digging into datasets to find interesting insights and asking the right questions that can make a real difference. I mainly use Python, R, and SQL, and I’m excited about applying statistical modeling and machine learning to solve practical problems.
