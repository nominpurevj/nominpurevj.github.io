Hi, my name’s Nomin and I’m a data science researcher, a tutor of Math, and a soon-to-be graduate from the University of British Columbia. I've gained experience with the data science pipeline (preparing, cleaning, exploring, modeling, and interpreting data) from working in a research laboratory, on personal projects, and from formal courses.  

I enjoy learning things hands-on and enjoy R, SQL, and Python for data science. I also love searching for "the right" questions while imposed under constraints from the datasets.  



If you're curious, I've created this website using Jekyll! Check out this info to learn more:
